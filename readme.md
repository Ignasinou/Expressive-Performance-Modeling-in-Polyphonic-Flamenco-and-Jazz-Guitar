# Expressiveness in Guitar Performance: A Case Study

In musical performances, expressive models have been proposed to analyze and characterize the deviations that a musician introduces when performing a musical piece. This work presents expressiveness in guitar performance as a case study.

## Challenges in Guitar Case Studies

The ability of the guitar to produce polyphonic sounds and its musical versatility results in a variability of sounds. This poses significant challenges in the automatic transcription and analysis of the recorded data when building the dataset for the model.

## The Rise of Data-Driven Methods

Data-driven methods have become increasingly popular to approach problems like guitar transcription. Therefore, datasets of labeled audio data are highly needed.

## Proposed System

This work proposes a system capable of collecting audio and MIDI annotations from guitar performances based on specific musical pieces, specifically jazz and flamenco. By recording guitar performances using a hexaphonic pickup, the system can provide recordings of the individual strings and largely automate the annotation process of the expressive content of the music performance.

## Use of Pretrained Machine Learning Model

A pretrained machine learning model is used to automatically generate music sequence excerpts based on the acquired data.

## Data Presentation and Evaluation

Finally, different sets of data are presented to compare results. Qualitative evaluations of the generated sequences are performed.
